# Linear-Regression-with-tf
This is my **First** DL model.
Doesn't really have too many features in it yet. 
what I learned from this project:
1. how to use dataset available online and do data processing so it is usable and good to be fed to the model
2. how to normalize data(so that outliars do not hinder the loss, especially in the RMSE loss)
3. how to fit and train a simple linear regression model and make it complex with tf.keras.layers.Dense and activation functions like relu(amonst many others)
